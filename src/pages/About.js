              Our mission is simple – to provide an ultra-hygienic Nails and
              Waxing lounge in a serene environment. We provide each client with
              a new disposable emery board, buffer, and pumice stone during
              their manicure and pedicure services. These are one-time-use
              tools, which will be discarded after each service, unless the
              client opts to take these items home. Welcome to Navy Yard Salon.
              It’s surprisingly refreshing.
